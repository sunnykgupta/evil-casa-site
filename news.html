            <div>So based off yesterday.  This is kinda where we are at... Ndr filled up with spots.  They originally offered 20, but that may of been a first day deal.  Currently they are closing doors to evaluate this week.  To see which R1’s they will let go. Phnx:  work in progress.  They have to figure out who to let go or where to move secondar accounts. Maybe somebody very special has been offline a while and they holding out hope.  Yall remember how long we kept barney’s useless azz.  At this point for anybidy to move is somebody they have to decide who to let go or kove to a farm. That leaves xtn.  Cooldsddy there now and he says to him just like evil.  Just not evil in there atm. Here is the beauty of it all.  Today it may be a split.  That does not lock anybody down from all saying f all this we reconvening somewhere.  Season 3 starts in a couple of days. Settle somewhere. Get the rewards. Remember none of us are r5, we cannot make things happen. So there yall go.  All the cards layed on the table..</div>
